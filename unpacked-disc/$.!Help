Instructions for *ONSLAUGHT* :   The game is basically a shoot-em-up, with the emphasis on fun rather than violence. The main character, Blurp, is a pacifist alien who has been bullied into attacking the HQ of an alien invasion centre. The rest of the suitably silly plot will be detailed at a later date.  Just to get you started, pressing Escape at any time will start up the game.  The keys are:    Z      - Left  X      - Right  SHIFT  - Jump  RETURN - Fire    It's as simple as that! Just shoot the nasties that appear from the generators, and collect the little tokens that their disappearing bodies leave behind! If you leave a token bouncing for too long, it will explode and eat up some of your valuable time.  Only a few 'taster' levels have been completed, we hope to supply about 40 as they are cleverly compressed and take up little space each. Note that after completing level 6, the computer will hang up, since it expects more levels - this will obviously not happen in the completed game.  Again, as this is an unfinished version, only 5 of the 8 possible monster types have been programmed, but you'll get the idea. Other possible monsters could be a caterpillar, jumping fleas or anything else we can draw!  The completed game will be better graded in difficulty, i.e. difficult levels will be nearer the end! Another addition will be that of sound, using direct poking to the sound chip.  We have tried to program Onslaught as concisely as possible, and the finished source code will be as compact as possible. However, as you would expect, a game of this quality is not short, but we are quite prepared to split the game into three distinct parts which could be typed in over three months, with accompanying information in a series of articles. Each part would run separately, giving an idea of how the game fits together. e.g, perhaps part 1 is the map and sprite printing routines, part 2 as the monster motion and logic routines, and part 3 as the general housekeeping routines which draws the three parts together as the full game.    We believe we are giving the 6502 a good run for its money - printing the whole screen every frame at a frame rate of 25 Hz, with up to 16 monsters, 32 bullets/tokens and 128 dots on screen at once!  As the Beeb falls foul to the technological progress that created the ARM chip, we think that this game could be said to be a parting shot, given that things have pretty much dried up these days.   We hope you enjoy playing this game as much as we do, and if you have any comments on improvements, or have found any bugs, please don't hesitate to call Richard on (0483) 282511.  From,     Richard Talbot-Watkins,     and Matthew Godbolt. 2/3/93.   P.S    This text is also stored as an ASCII file called '!Help' if you want to print it out for later reference.P.P.S. A *INFO disc full of Beeb programs should wing its way to the BAU office as soon as this game has been fully programmed.
