Onslaught

An unreleased, unfinished BBC Micro game from 1993. Written by
 [Rich Talbot-Watkins](https://github.com/richtw1) and [Matt Godbolt](https://github.com/mattgodbolt)
 while they were both still at secondary school, it was due to be published as
 a series of articles in Acorn User until they (understandably) dropped support
 for the BBC Micro.

It is presented here as the original SSD image available also on the
 [Stairway To Hell](https://www.stairwaytohell.com/) archive, [original-disc.ssd](/original-disc.ssd),
 the disc unpacked, and as the source in decoded files. BBC BASIC programs are tokenised, and their
 detokenised equivalents are in the top level. The original code used `*LOAD` (in [Core](/Core)) 
 to load in three parts of the codebase. For convenience the combined code is in [AllSource](/AllSource),
 which is the best place to start reading code.

The game can be played on [jsbeeb](https://github.com/mattgodbolt/jsbeeb) or other emulators. To play
